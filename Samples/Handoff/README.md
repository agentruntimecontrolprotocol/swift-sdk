# Handoff

Cheap-tier first; escalate to a deep tier via `agent.handoff` when the
cheap model's confidence drops below threshold.

## Before ARCP

Routing layers either burn the most expensive model on every call, or
shard by a static rule (regex on the prompt) and silently mis-route hard
requests to the cheap path. Conversation context gets POSTed across as a
JSON blob with no integrity check, no trace propagation, and no runtime
verification.

## With ARCP

```swift
let ref = try await packageContext(cheap, transcript: ...)   // artifact.put
try await emitHandoff(cheap, artifactRef: ref, traceId: traceId)
```

The deep runtime is identified by `kind` + pinned `fingerprint`;
mismatch = refuse. Context rides as an `artifact_id`, not an inline
blob — sha256 + media_type included.

## ARCP primitives

- Capability negotiation distinguishes the tiers — RFC §7.
- `agent.handoff` + runtime identity verification — §14, §8.3.
- Artifacts for transcript transfer — §16.
- Trace propagation across the handoff — §17.1.

## File tour

- `Sources/Handoff/main.swift` — open cheap (pinned), ask, escalate
  if needed.
- `Sources/Handoff/Cheap.swift` — `attempt` stub +
  `ARCPClient.placeholder`.

## Variations

- Three tiers (haiku → sonnet → opus) with two thresholds.
- Sticky-handoff cache keyed on a request fingerprint so repeated hard
  prompts skip the cheap pass.
- Deep tier holds the session; cheap closes immediately after emitting
  the handoff (current shape) — or both stay open for back-and-forth.
